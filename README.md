# VoronoiCity

When I was looking at the Voronoi noise with rounded edges, I felt like I could create a city using the white edges as roads. 3D shapes were stacked and rotated to look like buildings and placed within the Voronoi regions with the image of Tokyo. Noise, 3D shapes, and skybox were all created procedurally.
See below.
